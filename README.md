# hello-world
My hello world project for CS35.

I was entirely homeschooled from K-12 without ever attending a formal school. I started taking community college classes at 15, and then diddled along with 1-2 classes for the next three years or so, then spent one year actually taking a bunch of classes, then tried to transfer and failed, then took another semester of classes, then successfully transferred to Pitzer. Blah blah blah words about myself. Learned American Sign Language (ASL) while in community college - kinda odd how community college had so many courses and subjects that I can't find at the Claremonts... Okay, bored now. Have a good evening, dear grutor!
